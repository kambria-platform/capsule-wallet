# RELEASE LOG

## 1.10.0

* Major release.

### Fixes

* Update the documents.
* Remove subtitle and testing logo.
* Beautify Softwallet icon.
* To avoid mistaking the package funtionality 🤯, we decided to change the title from "Capsule Wallet" to "Capsule Bridge".
* No longer use a seperate font, for now we will follow the font in your sides.

### Enhancements

* Support Goerli network (Network ID is 5️⃣).
* Support Page-Refreshing, that led us to introduce `window.capsuleWallet.logout()` function, new `props` includes `networkId, restrictedNetwork, pageRefreshing`.
* Group MEW to the type of Hybridwallet.
* A 🎁 would be hidden for fun, let's find it.
* [DEVELOPER TRIGGED] We unified the way of generating `web3` instance by `web3Factory`.
* [DEVELOPER TRIGGED] Use `sessionStorage` as a safe way for cache. Then we can say goodbye to `node-cache`.
